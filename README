This repo contains ASIOauthRequest, a first pass at adding OAuth support to the ASIHTTPRequest set of network classes.

Currently ASIOauthRequest works with OAuth 1.0, and should support both Mac OS X and iPhone OS. The current implementation is restricted to POST rather than GET. 

Currently work in progress.
